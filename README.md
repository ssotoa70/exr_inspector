# exr-inspector

**Authoritative OpenEXR introspection, validation, and analysis for high-end VFX and animation pipelines.**

exr-inspector is a serverless Python function designed for **VAST DataEngine** that provides comprehensive OpenEXR file introspection, validation, and analysis. Built for studio-grade environments (Pixar/DreamWorks class), it solves the problem of fragmented EXR tooling by providing lossless metadata extraction, safe streaming-based pixel analysis, policy-driven validation, and deterministic, machine-readable JSON output.

## Features

### Current (v0.9.0 — Release Candidate)

- ✅ **Complete Header Metadata Extraction** — Lossless parsing of all EXR attributes, color spaces, and channel definitions
- ✅ **Multipart & Deep EXR Support** — Robust navigation through complex EXR structures via OpenImageIO
- ✅ **Type-Safe Serialization** — Handles exotic OIIO types (vectors, matrices, boxes, binary blobs) → JSON
- ✅ **Streaming-Ready Architecture** — Never loads full pixel data; reads headers only
- ✅ **Event-Driven Serverless** — Runs on VAST DataEngine with zero infrastructure management
- ✅ **Defensive Error Handling** — Gracefully handles malformed EXR files without crashing
- ✅ **VAST DataBase Persistence** — Transactional writes with idempotent upserts and deterministic vector embeddings
- ✅ **Vector Embeddings** — 384D metadata vectors and 128D channel fingerprints for AI/ML workflows
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing** — 45+ unit tests with full coverage

### Known Limitations (v0.9.0)

- ⬜ **Pixel Statistics** — Deferred to v1.1 (per-channel min/max/mean/stddev/NaN/Inf counts with configurable sampling)
- ⬜ **Validation Engine** — Deferred to v1.2 (policy-driven rules for structural, channel, compression, and naming validation)
- ⬜ **Deep EXR Analytics** — Advanced sample-level analysis deferred to v1.2+

**Note**: The schema is prepared for these features with reserved fields and table structure. No additional schema changes will be needed when these features are added.

### Planned Features (v1.1+)

- 🔮 **Phase 2+** — Policy DSL, asset DB export, hashing, EXR diffing, ML-ready embeddings

---

## Goals

- **Lossless metadata extraction** from OpenEXR files without information loss
- **Safe, streaming-based pixel analysis** with explicit opt-in (no full-image loads)
- **Policy-driven validation** against customizable studio rules
- **Deterministic, machine-readable JSON output** for pipeline automation
- **Studio-grade reliability** for integration with VAST DataEngine and VAST DataBase

## Entry Point & Architecture

The complete implementation lives in **`functions/exr_inspector/main.py`**. The serverless handler (`handler(ctx, event)`) orchestrates the inspection workflow:

```
EXR File → OpenImageIO Reader → Header/Attributes/Channels → Schema Normalizer → JSON Output + DB Write
```

### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `handler(ctx, event)` | Main DataEngine entry point; orchestrates entire inspection |
| `_parse_config(event)` | Extracts feature toggles from event payload |
| `_extract_file_path(event)` | Robust file path extraction (supports multiple key names) |
| `_inspect_exr(path)` | Core EXR parsing; navigates multipart structures |
| `_spec_to_part(spec, index)` | Converts OIIO image spec to part metadata |
| `_spec_to_channels(spec, part_index)` | Extracts channel definitions with sampling rates |
| `_attributes_from_spec(spec)` | Normalizes all EXR attributes |
| `_serialize_value(value)` | Recursive serializer for complex OIIO types → JSON |
| `_persist_to_vast_database(...)` | Placeholder for VAST DataBase writes |

---

## Configuration

The function accepts configuration via the event payload:

```python
InspectorConfig:
  enable_meta: bool = True          # Extract metadata (default enabled)
  enable_stats: bool = False        # Compute pixel statistics (not yet implemented)
  enable_deep_stats: bool = False   # Deep EXR stats (not yet implemented)
  enable_validate: bool = False     # Run validation rules (not yet implemented)
  policy_path: Optional[str] = None # Path to validation policy (future)
  schema_version: int = 1           # Output schema version
```

### Output Schema

```json

  "schema_version": 1,
  "file": {
    "path": "string",

## VAST DataBase Integration

### Overview

exr-inspector automatically persists extracted metadata to **VAST DataBase** via serverless DataEngine functions. This integration enables:

- **Persistent metadata storage** — All EXR header attributes, channel definitions, and file metadata are transactionally written
- **Vector-based analytics** — Metadata embeddings enable semantic queries across renders (e.g., find similar channel configurations)
- **Hybrid querying** — Combine vector similarity searches with SQL filters for precise asset discovery
- **Serverless persistence** — No additional infrastructure; DataEngine functions handle all database writes

### Configuration

To enable VAST DataBase integration, set the following environment variables in your VAST DataEngine function configuration:

```bash
VAST_DB_ENDPOINT=https://your-vast-instance.example.com
VAST_DB_ACCESS_KEY=<your-api-key>
VAST_DB_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
VAST_DB_SCHEMA=exr_metadata  # Optional; defaults to 'exr_metadata'
```

These credentials are used by the `_persist_to_vast_database()` function to establish authenticated connections and write metadata transactionally.

### Database Schema

The VAST DataBase schema includes:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **files** | Root records with file path, size, mtime, and metadata embeddings |
| **parts** | Multipart EXR structures (index, name, dimensions, tile info, compression) |
| **channels** | Channel definitions (name, type, sampling rates, associated part) |
| **attributes** | Key-value EXR attributes with type information for efficient querying |

For detailed schema definitions, sampling strategies, and index configuration, see **[VECTOR_STRATEGY.md](./docs/VECTOR_STRATEGY.md)**.

### Vector Capabilities

With metadata persisted to VAST DataBase, you can:

- **Find similar renders** — Query by metadata vector to discover renders with matching channel structures or attributes
- **Query by channel patterns** — Filter files by channel names, types, and sampling configurations
- **Hybrid queries** — Combine vector similarity (e.g., "find renders with similar color space setup") with SQL predicates (e.g., "and width >= 1920")
- **Attribute-based discovery** — Search by custom EXR attributes (e.g., DCC software, artist name, project code)

See **[VAST_ANALYTICS_QUERIES.md](./docs/VAST_ANALYTICS_QUERIES.md)** for query examples and best practices.

### Deployment

To deploy exr-inspector with VAST DataBase persistence:

1. **Set environment variables** in VAST DataEngine function configuration:
   ```
   VAST_DB_ENDPOINT=...
   VAST_DB_ACCESS_KEY=...
   VAST_DB_SECRET_KEY=...
   VAST_DB_SCHEMA=exr_metadata
   ```

2. **Configure S3 triggers** (or other storage events) to invoke the function on file uploads:
   ```
   Trigger: s3:ObjectCreated:*
   Prefix: renders/ (optional)
   Function: exr-inspector
   ```

3. **Monitor persistence** via DataEngine logs:
   ```
   [INFO] Persisting metadata for path=renders/shot_001.exr
   [INFO] Wrote 1 file, 3 parts, 12 channels to VAST DataBase
   ```

For complete deployment instructions, see **[docs/deployment-checklist.md](./docs/deployment-checklist.md)** and **[docs/SERVERLESS_INTEGRATION.md](./docs/SERVERLESS_INTEGRATION.md)**.

### System Libraries

- **libopenimageio-dev** — Development headers for OpenImageIO
- **libopenexr-dev** — OpenEXR C++ library headers

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Event-Driven Serverless Design

- **Stateless handler** receives events from VAST DataEngine triggers
- **Single responsibility**: Parse input → extract metadata → output JSON → persist to DB
- **No infrastructure management** — scales automatically with pipeline demand

### Defensive Programming

- Graceful error handling (returns errors in JSON, never crashes)
- Robust configuration parsing (coerces multiple input types)
- Try/except protection for malformed EXR files
- Detailed error messages for pipeline debugging

### Type-Safe Serialization

The `_serialize_value()` function handles complex OIIO types:
- Binary blobs (base64 encoded)
- Vectors (x, y, z, w attributes)
- Colors (r, g, b, a attributes)
- Boxes (min/max attributes)
- Matrices and numpy-like types
- Recursive descent for nested structures

### Streaming-Ready

- Never loads full pixel data (headers only)
- Pixel stats/analysis currently stubbed for future implementation
- Supports multipart and deep EXR navigation via OIIO subimage iteration
